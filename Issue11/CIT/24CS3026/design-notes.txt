Artist Choice (Ed Sheeran): He was selected for his universal mass appeal. Placing his understated, acoustic style against a loud, dramatic Bollywood backdrop creates a fun, ironic visual contrast that generates hype.

Vintage Aesthetics: The design mimics 1970s-80s Indian cinema hoardings using a Technicolor gradient (sunshine yellow to deep magenta) and hand-painted brush typography rather than modern digital fonts.

"Movie Premiere" Vibe: Instead of a glossy photo, a digital illustration of Ed is used to pay homage to hand-painted movie posters. Icons like the disco dancer silhouette, film camera, and vinyl record reinforce the "Rangara" vintage theme.

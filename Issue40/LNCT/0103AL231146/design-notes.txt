Design Concept:

The Effervescence 2025 logo reflects a vibrant, playful fest identity rooted in creativity and celebration. The design embraces a free-flowing, hand-crafted approach to represent the expressive and youthful spirit of the festival.

Typography & Letterform Style:

Custom brush-style lettering is used instead of a fixed font, giving each letter a raw, artistic personality. Uneven strokes, soft curves, and overlapping forms create motion and energy, making the text feel alive and dynamic.

Color & Visual Treatment:

Bright, saturated colors inspired by festive and cultural tones are applied individually to letters, enhancing visual impact and diversity. Rough textures and shadowing add depth and a hand-painted feel.

Background & Composition:

A soft pastel background with diagonal divisions and abstract scribbles balances the bold typography. Subtle shapes and lines support the main text without overpowering it.

Overall Intent:

The logo is designed to feel fun, expressive, and student-driven rather than corporate. It aims to stand out across posters, banners, and digital platforms while clearly representing the energetic identity of Effervescence 2025.

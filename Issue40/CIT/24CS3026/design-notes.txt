To capture the high energy and spirit of the event, I’ve focused on a dynamic visual theme featuring a vibrant explosion of neon colors resembling a Holi celebration which pops vividly against the solid black background.

I chose a glowing, bubbly typography style for the text to align with the theme of 'effervescence,' using a gradient of bright colors that ties the title and the year 2026 together cohesively. This layout is designed to be eye-catching and celebratory, ensuring the event name stands out immediately while conveying a sense of excitement and motion to your audience.
